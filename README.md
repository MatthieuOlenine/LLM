The file "Default.xlsx" in NeuralNetwork directory is a shape for the neural network without any training.


Please create a trained neural network with the NeuralNetworkBuilder.py before run LLM.py.


The NeuralNetworkBuilder use all data in TrainingData to create a new neural network.


This new neural network have the same shape from the default one but not the same content, depend of the datas in TrainingData directory.


Then you can use LLM.py.


You can also use "Corrected.xlsx" for a trained data base.


Pandas required, install it with "apt install python-pandas" in bash. Run LLM.py and NeuralNetworkBuilder.py with "python3 [filename]" in bash.
