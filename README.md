The file "Default.xlsx" in NeuralNetwork directory is a form for the neural network without any training.
Please create a trained neural network with the NeuralNetworkBuilder.py before using LLM.py
The NeuralNetworkBuilder use all data in TrainingData to create a New Default neural network.
This New neural network have the same form from the default one but not the same content,
depend of the datas in TrainingData directory. Then you can use LLM.py
